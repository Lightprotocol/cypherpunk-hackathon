**Cypherpunk Hackathon Ideas**

**(i) DeFi**
- **Launchpads**: Designs for rewards/launches/loyalty with compressed tokens.
- **Adapters**: UI/APIs for atomic compressed Token integration with swaps/apps/liquidity.
- **Liquidity mining**: Systems using compressed Tokens/PDAs.

**(ii) Crypto Infrastructure**

- **Rent reclaim suite**: UIs to compress accounts and reclaim rent without data loss.
- **Staking**: an application that uses compressed Tokens/PDAs for stake accounts.
- **Identity verification**: an application that uses compressed PDAs for user profiles.
- **zk-Oracles**: an oracle that proves TLS signatures inside a SNARK and uses compressed PDAs to store data

**(iii) Consumer Apps and Stablecons**

- **Gamified learning**: Loyalty points, levels and reputation via compressed tokens.
- **Token distribution**: Tools for user acquisition/retention using compressed tokens.
- **Micro-transactions**: Compressed tokens for app interactions, creator tips, ad platforms.
- **Payment APIs and Transfers**: Batch payments via compressed tokens.

**(iv) Gaming**

- **Text adventure engine**: On-chain state storage via compressed PDAs.
- **Prediction markets**: Compressed token wagering on social content.
- **In-game asset marketplace**: Trade skins/items using compressed tokens.

**(v) DePIN**

- **Nodes**: Store operator metadata using compressed PDAs
- **Rewards or Points**: Batch payments to node operators with compressed tokens
- **Sensor data aggregation**: Historical IoT data via compressed PDAs
- **Supply chain**: Track provenance using compressed PDAs

**(vi) Visualizers and Dashboards**
- **Blockchain** **Explorer**: visualizers for Solana transactions that involveÂ ZK Compression
- **Storage cost savings UI**: tools that visualize global rent savings with ZK Compression vs. regular Solana accounts based on account size or tokens in the user's wallet.
- **Global State Tracker UI**: a tool that tracks global state growth and compressed / regular state
